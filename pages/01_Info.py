        "description": "<p style='font-size:22px'>Diabetes is a chronic medical condition that affects how your body regulates blood sugar (glucose), which is a primary source of energy for your cells. When you eat, your body breaks down the carbohydrates in your food into glucose, which then enters your bloodstream. In response to rising blood sugar levels, your pancreas releases a hormone called insulin, which helps your cells absorb and use glucose for energy. This process helps maintain your blood sugar at a stable level. Diabetes occurs when there's a problem with this glucose regulation system.",

It is one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Heart disease encompasses various conditions, with the most common being coronary artery disease, heart failure, and arrhythmias. Symptoms of heart disease can vary but may include chest pain or discomfort, shortness of breath, fatigue, dizziness, and irregular heartbeats. Some people may experience no symptoms until a heart attack occurs.",

But sometimes, they get changes (mutations) that cause them to keep making more of themselves when they shouldnâ€™t. Damaged cells dividing uncontrollably create masses, or tumors, of tissue that eventually keep your organs from working properly.",
